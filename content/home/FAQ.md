### How Do I Become a Member?
Membership is by invitation only. While we do bring on new members (and are thrilled with every member that agrees to join), we are managing our growth very carefully as we institutionalize our efforts. Most everyone has been in some group that has started with a “bang!” and ended with a fizzle, and that’s never a great experience. So, too, group administration takes time and effort, and this increases as group size grows. With these considerations, our aim is sustainable inclusivity.

One of the ways to gain consideration for membership is to have presented to the group. Presentations are by invite-only. Any member can propose a presentation to the Steering Committee and offer to host at one of our six yearly meetings. 

### Can I Sit in on a Meeting?
Members, presenters, and the presenters’ co-authors may attend meetings.

### Can My Organization Sponsor a Meeting or Transitions-Related Research Done by TRG Members?
Yes! If your organization has an interest in transitions-related research and wants to sponsor either a meeting or research that members might be doing on a related topic, please do reach out by filling out [this](/#sponsor-contact) form
