## About Us

So, what’s the Transitions Research Group (TRG)? Essentially: if we were a journal, we would probably be the _Academy of Management Collections_, which brings together curated articles around some organizations-relevant topic. We’re a loose federation of about 40 scholars from different institutions, on different continents (Europe + USA), at different career stages, and using different methodologies whose research/personal interests can somehow be made to fit under a “transitions” umbrella. 

Our history reflects the reconfigurations of work and meetings afforded (and forced) by the COVID-19 pandemic. What was supposed to be a small workshop on “The Transition to Retirement,” hosted by George Mason University in Spring of 2020 turned into a virtual conversation that brought together many more scholars (and practitioners!) than anticipated. It was worthwhile enough to continue meeting, and we’ve kept the effort going. Our bi-monthly meeting now provides a place for scholarly conversations around important topics of concern, and research presentations by either our members or people whom a member invites. We have fun, and work to provide a helpful forum for our presenters.

### Our Members
Our members have done or continue to do scholarly work on some topic relevant to transitions—at the personal, professional, organizational, or societal level of analysis. On this website, we list just a small part of what they have published in academic or practitioner outlets, to draw attention to their role in building a “transitions” scholarly community. Please see individual member websites or CVs for their full corpus.
