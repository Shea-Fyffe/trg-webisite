I am doctoral student in Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology Program working with Dr. Phil Lee. I was born and raised in Ohio. I attended Marshall University (West Virginia) for my undergraduate where I took interest in I/O Psychology. After graduating, I spent a year and a half in Omaha, Nebraska working as a research developer, map-maker, and test administrator. I then returned to academia; getting my masterâ€™s degree in I/O from Radford University. I worked as a Psychometric Data Analyst for roughly 3 year before being accepted to George Mason University. I love to hike and exercise, take mediocre landscape photos, play trivia/board games, and program in R until 3 a.m.
