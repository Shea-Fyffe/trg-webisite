Elise Jones is an Assistant Professor in the School of Leadership & Management at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Dr. Jones received her Ph.D. in Management and Organization from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College. Her research focuses on how people negotiate work-related identities and find meaning in their work in the context of social norms, and how interpersonal relationships shape the way they navigate related tensions. Her work has been published in Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Perspectives, and Research in Organizational Change and Development.
 
Dr. Jones teaches courses in Human Resource Management and Leadership, Organizational Development & Change to Coast Guard officers in training. She coaches a multi-year capstone team investigating factors that promote the retention of women in the Coast Guard and cultivate an inclusive work environment for all Coast Guard members.
 
Prior to entering academia, Dr. Jones held product management, business strategy, and human resources roles in small, medium, and large organizations in the technology industry. She enjoys spending time in nature with her family, making music, experiencing good food, and practicing her faith.
