Cy is currently a rising Junior at George Mason University pursuing a Game Design Major along with a Global Affairs Minor. He's from Lynchburg Virginia and graduated from E.C. Glass High School and the Central Virginia Governorâ€™s School for Science and Technology in 2020. His hobbies include running, playing video games, camping with friends, and learning about history and geopolitics. A fun fact about him: he completed my first ultramarathon last fall, the Mountain Masochist Trail Run 50k.
