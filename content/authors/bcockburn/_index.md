Bethany Cockburn earned her Ph.D. from the University of Iowa (2018). Her expertise and interests relate to workplace stress, work-related identities in the changing work world, and how being on a team affects individual and team outcomes. Specifically, she has studied the impact of stress on physical and mental health and mortality; the effect of retiring and returning to work on oneâ€™s identity; and how team membership affects helping behaviors, deviant behaviors, and performance.
