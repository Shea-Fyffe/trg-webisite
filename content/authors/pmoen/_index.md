Phyllis Moen (pronounced Mow-in) holds the McKnight Endowed Presidential Chair in Sociology at the University of Minnesota.

Professor Moen studies the mismatch between outdated work-time and career/retirement scripts and 21st century workforce and economic realities.  She also studies gender differences and disparities at all stages of the changing life course.

With Erin Kelly (MIT) and the Work, Family and Health Network, she investigates organizational work-time policies and practices, employee time strains, psychological and physical health outcomes; this includes the effects of an organizational-level innovation aimed at increasing supervisor support and employee control over where and when they work.

Dr. Moen is incoming president of Work and Family Researchers’ Network, a large interdisciplinary and international association. She received the Dean’s Medal in 2015, as well as the Sociology Department’s mentorship award. Dr. Moen was awarded a fellowship at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study of the Behavior Sciences for the 2015-16 academic year.
